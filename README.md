# Dependencies

**Make sure you have node.js at version >= 10 installed**

After that, clone this repo, open a terminal, cd over to the directory and run

```npm run dev```.

API should be running on port 3000, and frontend should be running on port 8081.

In other words, visit ```localhost:3000``` and/or ```localhost:8081``` to see what's up.

Don't touch .gitignore, or else [@vivkpatl](https://github.com/vivkpatl) will be very angry!!!
